                <h2>HI THERE! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
                <p>I'm Salvador. Ever since I was kid I was always very interested in computers 
                    and technology. I remember I would spend most of my days after 
                    school playing around with a Windows PC pretending to have some kind
                    of job where I would use my computer to make the world a better place.
                    Fast forward to today I find myself with the same passion and interest.
                    I currently work in a position where I leverage technology to help small business
                    owners grow their business. The role has helped me understand the user experience  
                    and have solid understanding of how to translate the problems our users experience
                    and turn that into data for the enhancement of the product. In the last recent years 
                    I became certified as Full Stack Delevoper, which has helped me tremendously in completing
                    the circle between design and development.
